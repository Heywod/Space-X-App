# SpaceX Launch Tracker

Website built to easily get information about recent and upcoming SpaceX launches.

## Description

Display uses of HTML5, CSS3, Materialize CSS, Javascript, SASS, and REST APIs.

## Information

This project was something I knew I wanted to do to help answer a questions I get asked often when it comes to launches. This was a fun app to make that was helpful to demonstrate my understanding of REST APIs and asynchronous programming as well as my versatility in CSS frameworks. I was able to use miltiple fetch API calls and use Javascript to display the information in a styled manner.
